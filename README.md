# MobileDevelopementProject2

This was a project for the app developement class. To run it, you need to follow the instructions given in the README that is inside of the
project2 folder. Use the App.js file, screens folder, and one js file inside project2 instead of the App.js file expo generates by default.

The settings screen does not display anything interesting at the moment. It was a bonus part, and I decided to move on to more interesting
projects (although if I come up with interesting ideas, I may return....)
